invent match_custom to control match

change subop options to be list of subops

match '(', args, ')' as one subop (and leave args beyond)
    could match '((', args, '))', etc.  as well
    or maybe understand balanced?
    ugh, all of (, [, { are magic already...

match args as one subop (leave nothing)

if more than one subop wrap up into chain

also change global `r4` parsing to use subop so you can:

r4 ( what ) ( ever )
